		<p  style="font-family:bungee hairline;font-size:15px; font-style:regular;"> This was a documented experience when one afternoon I walked from Victoria University to my flat in Newtown. During the walk I photographed any form of network that could be connected to the internet. This included, road markings, power boxes, manholes, power poles, security cameras, electronic billboards, etc. This information was then collected and researched. The photographs taken were then transferred into viewable simple sketches for this website.  </p>

				Manholes & Markings
				</h1>

			<p style="font-family:bungee hairline;font-size:15px; font-style:regular;">
			Manholes are used as an access point for underground public utility maintenance, which allows for system upgrades and inspection. These manholes are a visual look into where certain network connections such as wires are placed. There are multiple different manholes in Wellington used for gas lines, electricty and storm water drains. Spray paint markings on the pavement are also used to convey messages to users. They can indicate information such as where the lines should be, where buried power cables should be placed, etc. These markings are often only understood by the workers who utilise them.

				Wires & cords
				</h1>

			<p style="font-family:bungee hairline;font-size:15px; font-style:regular;">
				Power poles can be used for holding the power lines that get used and get connected to buildings and homes. The poles themselves can also be used for street lamps which are connected to these network cables for wifi purposes. The photo on the bottom left showcases the newly placed fibre cables from chrous. These cables sit in coils until they are placed underground. These network cables are also used for traffic lights, electronic bus stops and weather stations, all attached to the power poles.

				Security</h1>
			<p style="font-family:bungee hairline;font-size:15px; font-style:regular;">

			Security cameras are used around Wellington in order to keep the public safe and watch suspicious vehicles or people. Most of these cameras are connected to a network source, to watch this in real-time and keep the footgate through a fixed connection to a router. There are multiple different types of cameras and can be seen in multiple different locations but can always be seen with wires coming out of them. Some newer scurity cameras are wireless and do not have these wires.

				>Power boxes</h1>
			<p style="font-family:bungee hairline;font-size:15px; font-style:regular;">
			Power boxes or "junction boxes" are an enclosed housing for an electrical connection which are used in order to protect these connections and provide a safety barrier. These boxes can be found in multiple different locations and sizes such as back of buidlings, on the pavement to notifiy workers of buried cables, and on the side of walls for companies such as chorus. These are the main source point for many different internet connections and often need maintenance as the larger boxes can contain hundreds of wires.
